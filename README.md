# VATA_Lotto: The Lottery of the Last Run

Welcome to the **VATA_Lotto** ecosystem, a specialized suite of tools designed for lottery trend analysis and strategy testing based on the unique **"Last Run"** (Recent Run) theory.

## 🧠 The Philosophy
Traditional lottery systems often fail because they rely solely on the "Law of Large Numbers." **VATA_Lotto** operates on a different principle: The rhythm of the immediate past. We focus on whether a current streak (Hit or Skip) is likely to **Continue** or **Break** based on its own historical volatility and trend.

## 👤 About the Author & Development
**Author:** Jasminko Arnautovic  
**Location:** Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina

I am the creator of the **"Last Run"** lottery theory. It is important to note that **I am not a professional programmer**. This entire software suite was brought to life by translating my mathematical concepts into Python through an intensive collaborative process with **Google Gemini AI**. 

This project proves that AI can empower domain experts to build sophisticated tools, bridging the gap between complex theory and functional software.

## 🛠️ Included Tools
1. **VATA_Lotto.py**: The main command center for analysis, filtering, and ticket generation.
2. **VATA_Validator.py**: A back-testing engine to find the "Sweet Spot" parameters for any lottery.
3. **VATA_SimPro.py**: A professional simulator for generating synthetic history for any lottery format (6/39, 5/30, 7/42, etc.).
